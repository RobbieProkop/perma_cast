Perma-Cast Concrete Contracting Ltd. (Perma-Cast) is committed to ensuring a safe, accident-free, and healthy work environment for all employees. Our philosophy is that workplace accidents can be prevented with careful attention to safety standards. A safe working environment does not create itself. It is the result of diligent work and careful attention to safety policies, regulations, safety procedures, and safe work practices.

Safety demands cooperation on everyone’s part. Thus, it is important that communication be kept open at all times between management and employees. Workers who notice hazards or other safety problems, or feel that they need additional training, must notify their supervisor. The supervisor and management will then address these concerns and take corrective action when warranted.

Everyone is obligated to know and understand the safety standards for their job position, and just as importantly, must abide by them. Supervisors must install a positive attitude and safety awareness in their workers through personal adherence, personal contact, training, and regular safety meetings. It is the duty of all employees and sub contractors to perform their work with the highest regard for the safety of themselves and fellow co-workers.

Our safety policies are based on past industry experiences and the current safety standards within Alberta. This means compliance with all safety policies is a non-negotiable condition of employment and must be taken seriously. Failure to comply is sufficient grounds for disciplinary action or termination of employment.

Safety and health are our top priority in this organization and is every bit as important as productivity and quality. In fact, they go hand in hand. Of course the best reason for you to observe these policies is because it’s in everyone’s best interest to do so. Conscientiously following this policy manual can help each of our employees and sub trades stay safe, healthy, able to work, play, and enjoy life to its fullest.

Our primary objective with this program is to ensure all employees remain accident free and enjoy their time working at Perma-Cast Concrete Contracting Ltd.
